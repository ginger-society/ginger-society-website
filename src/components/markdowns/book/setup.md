GingerBook is a single package and command that does not require any initial configuration. It is quickly deployable even into complex monorepo setups.

## Dependencies

```bash
pnpm add @ginger-society/ginger-book
```
It expects that `react` and `react-dom` are already installed.

## Add a story

GingerBook looks for all stories matching the glob `src/**/*.stories.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,mdx}`.

Let's create our first story:

```tsx title="src/hello.stories.tsx"
export const World = () => <p>Hey!</p>;
```

If you use `.js` for your React components (JSX), you have to import React explicitly:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
```

## Run and develop

```bash
pnpm ginger-book serve
```

Development mode. It will start a dev server and open your browser. This is ideal when you want to quickly develop your components.

## Build
```bash
pnpm ginger-book build
```

Production build. It creates a `build` folder and outputs GingerBook assets into it. This is optimized and minified version that you can deploy or use for testing.

You need to serve it through a http server. GingerBook has the `preview` command you can use.
```bash
pnpm ginger-book preview
```

## All-in-one

This is a full set of commands you can follow to get a basic setup from scratch:


```bash
mkdir my-ui-project
cd my-ui-project
pnpm init
pnpm add @ginger-society/ginger-book react react-dom
mkdir src
echo "export const World = () => <p>Hey</p>;" > src/hello.stories.tsx
pnpm ginger-book serve
```
